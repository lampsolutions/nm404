== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure "no more 404"? =

You can set the URL of you sitemap.xml and the number of records to be parsed in the admin backend. No more configuration is required.
It simply does what it is supposed to.

= Why some redirections seem to take too long? =

For some blogs with more than 10000 articles for example, it could take a little bit to search on that larger sitemap.xml the appropiate match for the request.
To avoid a delay you may either cache your sitemap.xml (e.g. through varnish) or put a static sitemap.xml in your document-root.
